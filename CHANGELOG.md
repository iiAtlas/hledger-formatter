# Change Log

All notable changes to the "hledger-formatter" extension will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added balencing suggestions
  - Appears automatically when cursor is on a posting line without an amount
  - Calculates the exact amount needed based on other postings in the transaction
  - Respects all formatting settings (alignment, negative commodity style, indentation)
  - Accept suggestions with Tab key for fast data entry
  - Only suggests when exactly one posting is missing an amount (unambiguous)
  - Configurable via `hledger-formatter.suggestBalancingAmounts` setting (default: enabled)
- Added autocomplete suggestions
  - Includes standard hledger account categories (assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, income, expenses)
  - Automatically discovers accounts from all journal files in workspace (including `!include` directives)
  - Case-insensitive deduplication of standard categories with user accounts
  - Configurable casing for standard categories via `hledger-formatter.defaultAccountCategories` setting
  - Hierarchical account completion with colon (`:`) trigger character

## [1.0.5]

This update works to bring the extension defaults closer to HLedger’s, including date formats, spacing, and handling of the negative commodity sign.

### Added
- Configurable transaction date format (`hledger-formatter.dateFormat`)
  - Mixed date-format parsing in both the formatter and sorter so `/`, `-`, or `.` separators are recognised interchangeably
  - Syntax highlighting update to recognise dotted dates alongside slashes/dashes
- Default negative commodity style now matches `hledger print` (`$-`) via `hledger-formatter.negativeCommodityStyle`, with the previous `-$` layout still available through the same setting

### Changed
- `formatOnSave` and `sortOnSave` now default to `false`, aligning with hledger’s default
- Sorting consumes parsed date components but preserves the original string formatting so journals stay untouched unless formatting is requested
